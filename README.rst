Static Advection Diffusion Equation
===================================

This example solves the weak form of the following static advection-diffusion equation, 

|static_advection_diffusion_equation|

using the Galerkin method. |velocity_vector|, |s| and |conductivity_tensor| are the velocity vector, source term and symmetric, positive definite rank two conductivity tensor respectively. The dependent variable |c| is a spatially varying scalar field (e.g. concentration of constituents or species). Note that the velocity field must be prescribed and is called the independent variable. In this example an isotropic and homogeneous material with |equation1| (identity tensor) and is considered. 

The independent variable, source term and boundary conditions are prescribed to match those required for the analytical solution.

The general form of the advection-diffusion eqaution is

|full_advection_diffusion_equation|.

Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/static_advection_diffusion_equation
  mkdir static_advection_diffusion_equation-build
  cd static_advection_diffusion_equation-build
  cmake -DOpenCMISSLibs_DIR=/path/to/opencmisslib/install ../static_advection_diffusion_equation
  make
  
This will create the example executable "static_advection_diffusion_equation" in ./src/fortran/ directory.

Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd ./src/fortran/
  ./static_advection_diffusion_equation
